# <My first portfolio project>

## Description

My motivation for this page was desiring to show what I can do and build an aesthetically pleasing page.
I built this page as a working project to describe myself and showcase my ability to use HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am hoping that the details stand out to any employers. I learned a lot about how to orient objects and images on a page. I learned about many of the capabilities of HTML and CSS while working on this project. More interaction will come as I progress through the boot camp!
